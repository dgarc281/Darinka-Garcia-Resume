        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-Business ðŸ’¼</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a sophomore at the University of California, Riverside. Iâ€™m currently pursuing a Business Administration major with an emphasis in Marketing. I am a strong working, immigrant woman with a passion to push through all barriers and be the best at what I do. I have a strong passion for business as well as leading. I have a numerous amount of skills and experience that can be helpful in all situations, as well as I am a quick-learner and team-oriented individual. I grew up in the U.S. with loving and hard working parents who taught me the importance of work ethic and endurance to help me achieve my goals. I was taught from a young age to be confident, strong, but also humble, all very important characteristics that I can bring to any environment I work in. I have a set of goals in mind and I will try everything to achieve any dreams I may have, combatting everything in between.<br><br>

        I started my first leadership roles in high school as I took lead on big events happening in my school. I also became president of 2 clubs, Key Club and Eco-League. My biggest leadership role in high school however was becoming Vice President of my student body, giving me a lot of experience in managing people and managing different events efficiently. In my work life Iâ€™ve always had very self-managing jobs at my City Hall. I canvass around the community and call folks from home with information and benefits that can help their families and our community. I work for Pacoima Beautiful, a non-profit organization that focuses on environmental justice and community engagement and aid. In 2020, despite the pandemic I went out with more driven individuals to help people complete their census to benefit their community. This year Iâ€™m helping people vaccinated in my community.<br><br>

        My recent clash with leadership and what drew me back to business administration was my role as Team Lead for Pacoima Beautiful. I managed a team of our 20 people who canvassed along with me all over the San Fernando Valley to help people get vaccinated against COVID-19. We distributed around nearly 700 appointments in only 3 months, and helped distribute thousands of personal protection equipment items. It was a very successful outreach project that helped thousands of people reach vaccines, pop-ups, clinics, and so much more from the comfort of their front door. I have a very strong love for my community, especially Pacoima because of the amazing folks that live here. We are all one with similar struggles and similar feelings about our community, and helping them protect themselves to the best of their ability in this pandemic is one of the most important things Iâ€™ve done in my life so far. When someone asks me in the future what I was doing during the COVID-19 Pandemic, I can tell them I was helping save peopleâ€™s lives.
